                    days of receiving notice of the material breach.

                <h2>Expectation of Proportional Value.</h2>
                <p>
                    If the Compensation payment token is a DAO Shares token the supply of which may be changed by the Client, the Parties
                    agree that the Services Provider shall have an expectation of proportional value in the Compensation. In the event that
                    the total supply of DAO Shares increases from the supply as of the Commencement Date - including by a token split or by
                    the creation or issuance of a separate class of shares or tokens that may have some claim on a portion of the economic
                    value of the DAO Shares - the Services Provider shall have the presumptive right to have its Compensation adjusted to
                    preserve its proportional value.
                </p>

                <h2>Expenses.</h2>
                <p>
                    The Client agrees to cover reasonably necessary fees and expenses that are incurred by the Services Provider in
                    fulfillment of the Scope of Services. The Parties agree to work in good faith to develop mutually agreeable expense
                    approval procedures.
                </p>

                <h2>Confidentiality.</h2>
                <p>
                    During the Term of Agreement, either party (as the “Disclosing Party”) may disclose or make available to the other party
                    (as the “Receiving Party”), non-public, proprietary, and confidential information of Disclosing Party that, if disclosed
                    in writing or other tangible form is clearly labeled as "confidential", or if disclosed orally, is identified as
                    confidential when disclosed or within 10 days thereafter, is summarized in writing and confirmed as confidential
                    ("Confidential Information"); provided, however, that Confidential Information does not include any information that: is
                    or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of Receiving Party's breach of this provision; is or
                    becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third-party source, provided that such third
                    party is not and was not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information; was in Receiving Party's possession
                    prior to Disclosing Party's disclosure hereunder; or was or is independently developed by Receiving Party without using
                    any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Disclosing
                    Party's Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Receiving Party would protect its own
                    Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially reasonable degree of care. The Receiving Party
                    shall not use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, or permit it to be accessed or used, for any purpose
                    other than to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall not
                    disclose any such Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the members of the Receiving Party who
                    need to know the Confidential Information to assist the Receiving Party, or act on its behalf, to exercise its rights or
                    perform its obligations under this Agreement. If the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or legal process to
                    disclose any Confidential Information, it shall, prior to making such disclosure and if legally permissible, use
                    commercially reasonable efforts to notify Disclosing Party of such requirements to afford Disclosing Party the
                    opportunity to seek, at Disclosing Party's sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy.
                </p>

                <h2>Limited Warranty.</h2>
                <p>
                    Services Provider warrants that it shall perform the Scope of Services: using personnel of commercially reasonable
                    skill, experience, and qualifications; and in a timely, workmanlike, and professional manner. Services Provider makes no
                    warranties except for those set out above, and disclaims all other warranties, whether express or implied, including but
                    not limited to implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Services Provider's sole and
                    exclusive liability and the Client's sole and exclusive remedy for breach of the limited warranty set out in this
                    provision shall be reperformance of the affected services.
                </p>

                <h2>Limitation of Liability.</h2>
                <p>
                    In no event shall Services Provider be liable to the Client or to any third party for any loss of use, revenue, or
                    profit or loss of data or diminution in value, or for any consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary, special, or
                    punitive damages whether arising out of breach of contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, regardless of
                    whether such damage was foreseeable and whether or not Services Provider has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages, and notwithstanding the failure of any agreed or other remedy of its essential purpose.
                </p>

                <h2>Governing Law.</h2>
                <p>
                    This Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including tort and statutory claims are
                    governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware in the United States of America,
                    without giving effect to any conflict of laws provisions thereof that would result in the application of the laws of a
                    different jurisdiction.
                </p>

                <h2>Negotiation.</h2>
                <p>
                    The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement promptly by

                    particularity (a) a statement of each party’s position and a summary of arguments supporting that position, and (b) the
                    name and title of the person who will represent that party and of any other person who will accompany them. Within 30
                    days after delivery of the notice, the designated person of both parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and
                    place. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by
                    any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any
                    purpose, including impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is
                    otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in
                    the negotiation.
                </p>
                <h2>Arbitration.</h2>
                <p>
                    Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement,
                    interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to
                    arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in [insert the desired place of arbitration] before one arbitrator. The
                    arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in
                    accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules or pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
                    Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any of the regularly constituted courts of the State of Delaware.
                    This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of
                    appropriate jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <h2>Amendment.</h2>
                <p>The Parties may not amend this Agreement except by written instrument signed by the Parties' wallets.</p>

                <h2>Entire Agreement.</h2>
                <p>
