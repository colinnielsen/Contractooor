    changes:
        DAO Services Agreement => Services Agreement
        DAO => client
        DAO Services Provider => Services Provider
        DAO Shares Token => Token
        made Remedy Period variable
        changed at-will>'notice' -> 'notify'
        made Notice Period variable
    will need:
        - network
        - token-name
        - contractooor-url
        - sablier-url
    
    must normalize:
        - token-amount / 10eDECIMALS
        - contract-length

    @victor: we need to discuss the 10% variability clause, how that's coded / how extra provisions are accomodated for, especially given this template is now generalized for "Clients" and "tokens" not DAOs and shares

                <p>
                    <b>Expectation of Proportional Value.</b>
                    This Agreement is entered into between the Parties with an understanding of the current proportion of the DAO Shares
                    specified in the Compensation section to the total supply of DAO Shares. In the event that the total supply of DAO
                    Shares increases from the supply as of the Commencement Date beyond a specified Adjustment Threshold percentage -
                    including by a token split or by the creation or issuance of a separate class of shares or tokens that may have some
                    claim on a portion of the economic value of the DAO Shares - the Services Provider shall have the presumptive right to
                    have its Compensation adjusted to preserve its proportional value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Expenses.</b>
                    The DAO agrees to cover reasonably necessary fees and expenses that are incurred by the Services Provider in fulfillment
                    of the Scope of Services. The Parties agree to work in good faith to develop mutually agreeable expense approval
                    procedures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Confidentiality.</b>
                    During the Term of Agreement, either party (as the “Disclosing Party”) may disclose or make available to the other party
                    (as the “Receiving Party”), non-public, proprietary, and confidential information of Disclosing Party that, if disclosed
                    in writing or other tangible form is clearly labeled as "confidential", or if disclosed orally, is identified as
                    confidential when disclosed or within 10 days thereafter, is summarized in writing and confirmed as confidential
                    ("Confidential Information"); provided, however, that Confidential Information does not include any information that: is
                    or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of Receiving Party's breach of this provision; is or
                    becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third-party source, provided that such third
                    party is not and was not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information; was in Receiving Party's possession
                    prior to Disclosing Party's disclosure hereunder; or was or is independently developed by Receiving Party without using
                    any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Disclosing
                    Party's Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Receiving Party would protect its own
                    Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially reasonable degree of care. The Receiving Party
                    shall not use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, or permit it to be accessed or used, for any purpose
                    other than to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall not
                    disclose any such Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the members of the Receiving Party who
                    need to know the Confidential Information to assist the Receiving Party, or act on its behalf, to exercise its rights or
                    perform its obligations under this Agreement. If the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or legal process to
                    disclose any Confidential Information, it shall, prior to making such disclosure and if legally permissible, use
                    commercially reasonable efforts to notify Disclosing Party of such requirements to afford Disclosing Party the
                    opportunity to seek, at Disclosing Party's sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Limited Warranty.</b>
                    Services Provider warrants that it shall perform the Scope of Services: using personnel of commercially reasonable
                    skill, experience, and qualifications; and in a timely, workmanlike, and professional manner. Services Provider makes no
                    warranties except for those set out above, and disclaims all other warranties, whether express or implied, including but
                    not limited to implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Services Provider's sole and
                    exclusive liability and the Client's sole and exclusive remedy for breach of the limited warranty set out in this
                    provision shall be reperformance of the affected services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Limitation of Liability.</b>
                    In no event shall Services Provider be liable to the Client or to any third party for any loss of use, revenue, or
                    profit or loss of data or diminution in value, or for any consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary, special, or
                    punitive damages whether arising out of breach of contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, regardless of
                    whether such damage was foreseeable and whether or not Services Provider has been advised of the possibility of such
                    damages, and notwithstanding the failure of any agreed or other remedy of its essential purpose.
                </p>

                    without giving effect to any conflict of laws provisions thereof that would result in the application of the laws of a
